# Performance Improvements by Pykess
------------------------------------

This mod adds several options in the "Mods" menu which aim to improve framerate, overall performance, and stability of the game.

A complete guide to the settings, as well as preset configurations, are available within the menu.

Special thanks to Ascyst for the help.

This mod supplants RemovePostFX and ReducePostFX.
